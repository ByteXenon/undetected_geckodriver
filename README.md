## Overview

Undetected GeckoDriver is a wrapper around Selenium's `webdriver.Firefox` class. It patches the Firefox binary to bypass detection mechanisms used by services like Cloudflare, Distil Networks, Imperva, and more. This package is intended for use with Selenium to automate web browsing tasks without being detected as a bot. It serves as a drop-in replacement for Selenium's `webdriver.Firefox` and can be used in the same way.

## Installation

You can install the package via pip:

```bash
pip install undetected-geckodriver
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use Undetected GeckoDriver:

```python
from undetected_geckodriver import Firefox

driver = Firefox()
driver.get("https://www.google.com")

# Use it like a normal Selenium driver ...
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Selenium 4.10.0+
